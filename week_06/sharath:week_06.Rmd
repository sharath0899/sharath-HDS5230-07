## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Strategic Selection of FQHC Sites for Mental Health Service Delivery
The population coverage approach, which considers residents within a 30-mile radius, will serve as the primary fitness function for selecting Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) sites for mental health service delivery. The objective is to maximize population coverage, ensuring that the chosen facilities serve the largest number of people in need of mental health services. By prioritizing FQHCs located in densely populated areas, limited resources can be allocated efficiently, reaching the greatest number of individuals while promoting equitable healthcare access.

This approach aligns with public health goals, as it enhances mental health service availability for diverse populations while addressing healthcare disparities. Several key assumptions underlie this model:

A 30-mile radius is considered an appropriate distance for mental health service access.
The demand for mental health services is assumed to be consistent across all populations, without adjusting for demographic variations.
All candidate FQHCs are presumed to have equal capacity to support additional mental health services.
Service delivery capacity is assumed to be uniform across selected sites, with patient count as the primary selection criterion.
Fitness Function and Population Coverage Calculation
The fitness function evaluates each FQHC site based on the total number of residents within 30 miles. This is determined by computing Haversine distances between FQHC locations and population data points, counting individuals whose distance to a facility does not exceed 30 miles. The raw count is then adjusted using a sampling fraction to estimate actual population coverage. The selection process aims to maximize this value, ensuring that the highest number of people gain access to mental health services.

Societal and Financial Benefits
From both a public health and economic perspective, this method is highly effective. By prioritizing sites with high population density, the allocation of scarce mental health resources is optimized, leading to a greater reduction in untreated mental health conditions. Additionally, a higher concentration of patients contributes to financial sustainability, as it increases service utilization rates, enhances operational efficiency, and supports the long-term viability of mental health programs.

This strategic approach ensures that mental health services reach the largest possible population, improving healthcare outcomes while maintaining cost-effectiveness and equity in service distribution.
